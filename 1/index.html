 I have been wondering for some time now why it is I struggle so much with actually using my blog. I think I finally have the reason, but first let me tell you the summarized sob story.
</p>
<p>
 I did what I had been advised to do: I looked at blogs online until I found ones I liked, and then went about making something similar, but no matter what I did I didn't
 <i>
  like
 </i>
 my own blog! and I don't feel the inspiration to use a webpage if doing so is devoid of any satisfaction. I had tried blogger templates, wordpress templates, and a few half cocked projects of my own (before I even knew javascript).
</p>
<p>
 Enter the revisitation. I think I finally found the solution. Most blogs flaunt past blogs in an attempt to make the reader read them too. This makes good sense in terms of getting people to go read your blogs and in a general use-sense. The problem though, is that I have a severe dislike for my own writing for completely irrational reasons. Maybe if I rewrote the blog 12 times (I just reworded this sentence 3 times) I would get over it? That sounds painful too. But stumbling onto Phil Hagelberg's
 <a href="//technomancy.us">
  Technomancy
 </a>
 I suddenly realized what it was. I want to write something, not worry about it, and not see it. I do want other people to see it, though really I care more about getting the "moment" out of my system and into a record than about people reading what I write. So just put a footnote and minimal anything into displaying the way around, and focus entirely on just
 <i>
  one blog at a time
 </i>
 .
