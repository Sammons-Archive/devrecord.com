 I don't know about you, but I choke a bit when people say 'work remotely'
</p>
<p>
 It's a simple matter of not being able to see what on Earth the other person is doing 50% of the time, and being unable to show/tell/sign/interpretive dance/communicate what you are trying to say. This inability is distracting - to say the least.
</p>
<p>
 Yet, at the same time I keep hearing of wizards off elsewhere who manage to work
 <i>
  only
 </i>
 remotely!
</p>
<p>
 I know it can be done, and I seriously slobber over the idea of working with anybody, anytime, anywhere, and creating pair-code. So I continue trying to find a way that will improve the experience.
</p>
<h4>
 The latest solution
</h4>
<p>
 <a href="https://floobits.com">
  floobits
 </a>
 : a magical solution - my cousin ran into it while we were discussing working on
 <a href="https://github.com/Sammons/GameSync">
  GameSync
 </a>
</p>
<p>
 I had discussed with one of my co-workers during my time as an intern at
 <a href="http://www.admcrs.com/">
  ADM CRS
 </a>
 the idea of modifying existing enterprise editors to sync them into a collaborative experience, and floobits is a better version of that idea, but just for programmers.
</p>
<p>
 It touts a clean online editor for any users who would like to watch/help with your coding, as well as plugins for
 <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">
  Sublime Text
 </a>
 ,
 <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">
  Emacs
 </a>
 , and
 <a href="http://www.vim.org/">
  Vim
 </a>
 -- currently a plugin is in progress for
 <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">
  IntelliJ
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 I was able to simultaneously hook up emacs, sublime, and the online editor and watch myself code live - so let me tell you it works beautifully. Although there is some wierdness with the minibuffer in emacs - I am sure a better elisp wizard could fix it instantly.
</p>
<p>
 Now I can work with people at the drop of a hat with my custom dvorak oriented keybindings on sublime! Enter
 <a href="//devrecord.com/voip">
  voIP
 </a>
 and I think we are approaching an excellent solution - Enter Chrome Remote Desktop, and I think I am finally ready
</p>
<p>
 I will probably be back with a better, less hype-ey, blog when I finally have the experience I am looking for.
