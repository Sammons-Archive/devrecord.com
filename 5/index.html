 "How long do you think you will need?"
</p>
<p>
 This question plagues me. I am a fairly inexperienced developer, and have few finished products. I
		know what generally goes into making an app function securely, and find the tasks in creating it
		manageable - but I have no idea how long it will take me. I am really quickly learning that the time
		it takes is
 <i>
  much
 </i>
 more than what I had anticipated. I also find that no matter how many designing and planning meetings there are before development proceeds, each point must be beat to death at every angle before new doubts stop interfering with developmental design and implementation.
</p>
<p>
 The extra kicker is that things like testing state and security are difficult to factor in. If it takes me half an hour to make a generic form, another half to scrape the data in js (let's say I'm slow, or	very careful that day). Then it could take me an indefinite amount of time later in ensuring that the		data all hooks in and can be manipulated either way. Right now any ruby-ist would be saying to stop doing what I'm doing and use their crap - but really I can't. Why not? My boss said so.
</p>
<p>
 The realistic state of things in many enterprise tech groups is that there are tremendous arbitrary constraints on the type of software used, and the manner in which it is used. The reasons behind the constraints usually aren't insane, and you just get to live with them. So how do I, as an inexperienced developer unable to use flashy new tools, both get things done fast and well; and estimate the time it will take me to do so?
</p>
<p>
 Well, in the mean time I will just do my best, be wrong, and hope management has mercy on me.
